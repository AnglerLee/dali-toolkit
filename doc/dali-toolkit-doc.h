 * @brief DALi is a cross-platform 3D UI Toolkit for embedded systems.
 *
 * @section dali-overview Overview
 * DALi's 3D user interface engine enables you to create rich and high-performance
 * UI applications. DALi is based on OpenGL ES 2.0, but provides a clean
 * cross-platform C++ framework.
 * This means that you can use high-level DALi APIs instead of accessing
 * low-level OpenGL APIs directly.
